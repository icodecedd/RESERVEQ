## 📊 Project Status  
**Under Development** — ReQuestor is an upcoming **web-based reservation and queue management platform** designed to replace outdated paper-based equipment request forms with a **streamlined, digital-first experience**.

---

## 📖 Overview  
**ReQuestor** is built for academic institutions such as **PUP San Juan** to simplify and modernize classroom equipment reservations — from projectors to white screens and beyond.  

### Key Benefits  
- **📄 Paperless Process** – Submit reservation requests online in seconds.  
- **⏱ Fair Queueing System** – First-come, first-served with timestamp-based ordering.  
- **🔎 On-Demand Availability Checker** – Select your desired date, time, and equipment to instantly see what’s available.
- **🛠 Admin Dashboard** – Approve, reject, or cancel bookings with one click.  
- **🔔 Notifications** – Email and in-app updates for every request status change.  

---

## ✨ Features by User Role

### 👩‍🎓 Student / Requestor
- Fully responsive interface for mobile, tablet, and desktop  
- Submit equipment reservation requests online  
- View request status (Pending, Approved, In Use, Returned)  
- Use the **On-Demand Availability Checker** to confirm availability of equipment before booking  
- Receive email and in-app notifications for updates  
- Cancel pending requests before approval  

### 🧑‍💼 Admin
- Desktop-first interface for efficient management  
- View, approve, reject, or cancel equipment requests  
- Manage equipment inventory and availability status  
- Track ongoing and upcoming reservations  
- Configure reservation rules (e.g., max duration, advance booking time)  

> **💡 Design Note:**  
> The **Student side** of ReQuestor is fully responsive and optimized for mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.  
> The **Admin dashboard** is designed primarily for desktop use, given that most administrative workflows occur on larger screens for better visibility and data management efficiency.
